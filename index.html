                </h3>
                <p>Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I could improve my design skills and
                    attract more customers. I wanted to start designing some ideas that for a long time I had only on
                    paper and stored on my cell phone, I decided to look for some challenge, something that makes more
                    sense with what I thought. I saw that many designers (especially in dribbble) made a daily user
                    interface, I really liked the idea, but the problem was that the result was just something nice and
                    did not solve any problem.

                        Only when you experience a problem yourself do you understand the frustration of the users and

                        As designers, we are often afraid of showing work that's not finished or doesn't look perfect.
                        You will learn to accept feedback and learn from it.
